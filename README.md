# songs-feedback

Thank Arthur for preparing this wonderful list of songs! I really enjoyed listening to them. They remind me of the happy times when I was in middle school. Here is my feedbacks. Each song is ranked in scale 1-5 in terms of rhythm and lyrics. I really enjoyed all of them, but to force variety I have to give some 1s or 2s. In the first couple of weeks, I let spotify shuffle played the list and then I listend and watched the lyrics in the order you gave me, just to make sure no song is being left behind. It was not surprising that I favor the songs that got picked by spotify more often.
